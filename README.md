# Priority Queue Implementations
- Coarse-Grained Lock Priority Queue 
- Fine-Grained Lock Priority Queue
- Lock-Free Priority Skip Queue

We implemented various Lock Based and Lock Free Priority Queue implementations, with a test suite that automatically compares performance benchmarks.
We tested using different thread counts and heavy Insert/RemoveMin function calls. One notable feature is the generic implementation of our Priority Queue allows any data structure to be used, as long as a priority is provided. 

The interface we are using for all our queues are shared: 
```java
public interface IPriorityQueue<T> {
    public void insert(T item, int priority);    
    public T removeMin();
}
```

# How to run program with mvn commands

## Running command line:

```java
Concurrent Priority Queue Program takes 3 arguments

args[0]:
        -c      Coarse Grained PQ
        -f      Fine Grained PQ
        -lf     Lock Free PQ
args[1]:
        #       Number of Threads
args[2]:
        #       Amount of work per threads

Examples:
        mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=pq.App -Dexec.args="-c 3 100"
        mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=pq.App -Dexec.args="-lf 4 200"
```

## running tests:
`mvn test`

### Running individual tests:
`mvn test -Dtest=SequentialTest`
`mvn test -Dtest=ConcurrentTest`


### Concurrent Test Interpretation/Example run
Our `mvn test -Dtest=ConcurrentTest` tests perform 60,000 insertions and deletions divided over 1 to 6 threads.
